Repository for codes I'm learning to write

Hello world!  I'm fatCam, and I'm just starting down the path to learn how to code!  I've done the 'Intro to Programming' Nanodegree through Udacity and am now on Exercism curently testing my knowledge on the Javascript and Python tracks.  Please be gentle, I'm very early on in my coding career...but I would love any and all the feedback I can get!
